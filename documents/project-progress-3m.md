# Project Progress Report

**Project Title:** PedRetinaExplorer Development  
**Duration:** January 1, 2024 - March 31, 2024  

## Summary

This report summarizes the progress made during the first three months of the PedRetinaExplorer development project. The project aims to develop an interactive tool for exploring retinal structure and data analysis, with a focus on pediatric cases.

## Accomplishments

1. **Online Meetings:**  
   - Four online meetings have been conducted to discuss project updates, challenges, and next steps. These meetings have served as crucial forums for collaboration and decision-making.

2. **Document Sharing:**  
   - Various documents, including case information (over 20 cases), research papers, and suggested approaches, have been shared among the team members. This has provided valuable insights and resources for the project's development.

3. **Feedback Incorporation:**  
   - Feedback received from Mehdi Afshari has been shared with the data collection member. This feedback has been instrumental in refining our data collection strategies and improving the quality of our dataset.

4. **PedRetinaExplorer Development:**  
   - The first version of PedRetinaExplorer has been created, which overlays the structure of the performing engine. This version includes a Streamlit implementation in Python, providing an intuitive and user-friendly interface.
   - A GitHub repository has been established to facilitate version control and collaboration. Links to the repository have been shared with the team members for better tracking and coordination.

5. **Feature Selection and Modification:**  
   - A set of features to use for search within PedRetinaExplorer has been selected and shared with the team. These features have been modified according to feedback received during team discussions, ensuring they align with project objectives and user needs.

6. **Search Engine Development:**  
   - The initial development of the search engine has commenced. Efforts are underway to implement the chosen features and functionalities, laying the foundation for advanced data exploration and analysis within PedRetinaExplorer.

## Challenges and Next Steps

1. **Data Integration:**  
   - Integrating diverse datasets and ensuring compatibility remains a challenge. Further efforts are needed to streamline data integration processes and ensure data consistency.

2. **User Feedback Incorporation:**  
   - Incorporating user feedback effectively into the development process will be crucial for enhancing the usability and functionality of PedRetinaExplorer. Regular feedback loops and user testing sessions will be prioritized in the coming months.

3. **Enhancement of Search Engine:**  
   - Continued development and refinement of the search engine functionality are essential to meet project objectives. Close collaboration between developers and domain experts will be maintained to ensure the search engine aligns with user needs.

## Conclusion

The first three months of the PedRetinaExplorer development project have seen significant progress across various fronts, including software development, data collection, and collaboration. Despite challenges, the team remains committed to delivering a high-quality, user-centric tool for exploring retinal structure and data analysis. With continued dedication and collaboration, we are confident in achieving our project goals in the upcoming months.
