**Project Proposal: PedRetinaExplorer**

**Executive Summary**

PedRetinaExplorer represents a pioneering initiative dedicated to the development of a sophisticated search engine designed to predict and evaluate pediatric retina responses to chemotherapy in children with retinal conditions. This project is inspired by an exhaustive review of pertinent literature in the realms of pediatric ophthalmology, neurophysiology, and artificial intelligence.

**Project Overview**

**Background**

Children undergoing chemotherapy for retinal conditions encounter distinct challenges, emphasizing the critical importance of predicting treatment outcomes for personalized interventions. The intricate nature of treatment outcomes in pediatric retinal conditions necessitates innovative solutions to aid healthcare professionals in optimizing patient care. A pivotal aspect for enhancing healthcare providers' capabilities lies in leveraging comprehensive information from analogous past cases, detailing treatments and outcomes. Addressing this challenge involves the implementation of a machine learning solution utilizing a data structure of past cases.

The proposed system utilizes machine learning algorithms to optimize relevancy based on a phenotype-based cost function. By discerning patterns within the data, the system identifies key factors influencing treatment outcomes, providing healthcare professionals with a curated selection of the top five relevant cases and their specific treatment approaches and outcomes. This approach streamlines decision-making and contributes to ongoing research in pediatric retinal chemotherapy.
