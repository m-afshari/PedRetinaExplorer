### Quick Start

- To run the project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/m-afshari/PedRetinaExplorer.git
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment:**
   Navigate to the project directory and create a virtual environment. This step is optional but recommended for managing dependencies.

   ```bash
   cd PedRetinaExplorer
   python -m venv venv
   ```

   Activate the virtual environment:

   - On Windows:
     ```bash
     .\venv\Scripts\activate
     ```

   - On Unix or MacOS:
     ```bash
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies:**
   Install the required Python packages using `pip` with the provided `requirements.txt` file:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Streamlit App:**
   Run the app using the following command:

   ```bash
   streamlit run src/app.py
   ```

   This command will start the development server and open the app in your default web browser.

*In essence, PedRetinaExplorer emerges as a pivotal resource in pediatric ophthalmology, offering a sophisticated and user-friendly solution for exploring, assessing, and gaining insights into chemotherapy outcomes in children with retinal conditions. By combining advanced technology with medical expertise, this project aims to significantly contribute to the improvement of treatment strategies and overall care for young patients.*
